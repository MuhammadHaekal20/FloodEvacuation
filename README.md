This Project code uses python and a genetic algorithm to solve the problem of evacuating flood victims. The algorithm selects victims for evacuation based on their weight and importance, such as pregnant women, toddlers, and the elderly. The code follows several steps, including selecting victims using the roulette wheel method, crossing chromosomes to create a new generation, and randomly mutating chromosomes
